# Feature Focus Roadmap

~~items~~ are complete

### 1. ~~**Create local dev enviroment on node.js**~~

### 2. **~~Make webapp run fairly easily on a mac~~**

  * I'm on Ubuntu so I assume it's \*nix capable

### 3. ~~Deploy to AWS~~

### 4. ~~README.md that contains the detailed instructions for running/installing app.~~

### 5. Must Have Features (form fields)
  * ~~**Title**: A short, descriptive name of the feature request.~~
  * ~~**Description**: A long description of the feature request.~~
  * ~~**Client**: A selection list of clients (use "Client A", "Client B", "Client C")~~
  * ~~**Client Priority**: A numbered priority according to the client (1...n).
   Client Priority numbers should not repeat for the given client,
   so if a priority is set on a new feature as "1", then all other
   feature requests for that client should be reordered.~~
  * ~~**Target Date**: The date that the client is hoping to have the feature.~~
  * ~~**Ticket URL**: A field for storing any URL~~
  * ~~**Product Area**: A selection list of product areas (use 'Policies', 'Billing', 'Claims', 'Reports')~~
